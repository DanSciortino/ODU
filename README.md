# ODU
These file is part of ODU.
This is my course work, I choose to use github to host the code, that I: Wrote or co-wrote from the help of a Teaching assistant(TA).
I wanted to to publish this code in case to help other programers.

They include work from introductory Computer Science classes learning C++ to Computer Architecture and VHDL.
